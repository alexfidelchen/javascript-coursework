// GLOBAL OBJECT 

/* The global object is the object we start out with when we write
	a script. The object is already initialized and we can use it
	at the start of the script. The cool thing about the global
	object is that we don't have to reference the object directly 
	when we call its methods. 
*/

/* So again, the object we start object with in the browser is 
	window.
