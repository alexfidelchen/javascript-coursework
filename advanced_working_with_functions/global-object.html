		directly, but there are some uses for it.

	/* Remember, each window and tab in a browser has a global 
		window variable. It's possible to embed a window inside 
		a window or tab using <iframe>. JavaScript allows windows 
		from the same website to access variables from each other.

	/* So generally, when you use the this keyword, its been inside the 
		an object you created. If you use this outside outside of any 
		bracket, this will refer to the global object. 
		
		If you're not using strict mode, using this inside a function 
		will get you the window object instead of undefined.
